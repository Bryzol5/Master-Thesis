# Master-Thesis
Masterâ€™s Thesis aims to systematically analyse and compare the predictive 
performance of different ML and AI models, such as Prophet, XGBoost (XGB), Random 
Forests (RF), and Deep Learning (DL) models, with the implementation of Artificial 
Association Systems, more precisely Associative Graph Data Structures (AGDS), in 
predicting the stock prices of selected companies. This investigation will be achieved by 
evaluating various statistical and financial metrics to discern the most efficient models.

No code attached as this might be later used for personal gain. 

Promising results for the task.\
For regression: Theli's U statistic of 1.1 and MSE of 1.1.\
For classification: Accuracy 82%, F1-score 72%.

Work done:
- Implemented different tactics,
- Substantial feature extration,
- Implemented different Machine Learning algorithms,
- Implemented different LSTM architectures,
- Implemented AGDS inspired data preprocessing.
